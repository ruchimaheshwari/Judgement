We created an iOS app using XCode of the game "Oh Hell!", also known as Judgement!

Rules to play "Oh Hell!" are here: https://www.pagat.com/exact/ohhell.html

To run the game, open the Cambio.xcodeproj file in XCode. Then create a new Assets.xcassets file with the 52 actual cards in the JPEG folder. After that, you should be good to play. Enjoy!
